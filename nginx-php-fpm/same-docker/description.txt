Proxy Servers : Nginx and Apache are reverse proxy servers used by web servers. Advantage of using proxy servers:
1) Loadbalancing, it handle heavy traffics
2) TLS/SSL termination
3) Caching therefore, fastest and best for serving static files like pdf, zip, html, php, png, .css, .js etc
4) Between Nginx and Apache, nginx can handle 4 times more concurrent connection than Apache and consume less CPU and RAM
5) Apache make new process for each web reques but nginx combines workeer process to handle multiple connections, hence consumes
less CPU and RAM, Nginx being asynchronous, non-blocking, event driven connection handling algorithm designed to serve static 
content quickly and handle dynamic requests of to other one or multiple web servers.
